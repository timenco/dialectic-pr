- Follow SOLID principles
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Error Handling

- Always use try-catch for async operations
- Log errors with appropriate context
- Return meaningful error messages to clients

## Security

- All user inputs must be validated
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, etc.)

## Testing

- Write unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Maintain >80% code coverage

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use async/await over Promise chains
- Follow the existing naming conventions in the codebase
